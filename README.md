# Tic-Tac-Toe Web Game

## Requirements

- User can create a new game board
- Allow two (and only two) players to connect to a game board
- Persist game state on the server
- Follow standard rules for tic-tac-toe (or noughts and crosses)
- Display the game result and persist in the database at the end of the game
- Display a ranking of the top five players and allow players to start a new game

## Technical Stack Requirements

- Frontend - React
- Backend - server of choice (e.g. Node, .NET, Java)
- Database - PostgresSQL


## Project Structure

```
apps/
├── backend/          # Backend application
├── frontend/         # Frontend React application
libs/
├── shares-types/     # Shared models package
```


### API Endpoints

- TODO




## General Plan

- build backend api to spec/requirements testing using mocks
- build frontend statically, host it on the backend
- create a dockerfile for the backend server and stuff the built frontend into it to be hosted
- create a docker-compose to spin up a local db and server for e2e local testing and dev

## Planned tech stack

### Backend

- tsx, express server, kysely typesafe hORM, vitest for testing

### Frontend

- react (with typescript), react query for data fetching, react router for client side routing, find a good fit ui library (shadcn potentially for customization?), plan is to operate largely off network state since we are requiring a joinable session and authoritative server, so initial thoughts are no lib for global state management required, if the need arises use react context.


## Initial thoughts

Based on requirements ill map out what endpoints i forsee needing:

- `/game/create (POST)` - creates a game session (will generate uid for game session)
- `/game/{id}/join (POST)` - join existing game session
- `/game/list (GET)` - list all available game sessions and # of participants (know if full)
- `/game/{id} (GET)` - get current state for a game by id
- `/game/{id} (PUT)` - update game state on an existing game (validate move and err if invalid)
- `/game/{id} (DELETE)` - deletes an existing game
- `/leaderboard (GET)` - get the top 5 players by # wins (elo system probably too much)

For the concept of users, I think oauth/any form of real auth is overkill for this game scenario, so for the sake of time I am deciding to create a more effortless flow where users visiting the site have a user automatically created for them and store the uuid of that user in the cookies, so if they return without clearing their cookies they will pick up where they left off

`/user/create (POST)` - create a user in the db with a uuid, temporary name
`/user/{id} (PUT)` - update user, this will primarily be for setting a name the user desires (and maybe a color for fun?)

initial plan is to build a restful backend with polling as mvp, and explore websockets or SSE if time permits for game-state

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/nx-api/node?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve backend
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build backend
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project backend
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/node:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/node:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

[Learn more about Nx plugins &raquo;](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) | [Browse the plugin registry &raquo;](https://nx.dev/plugin-registry?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
